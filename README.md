Credit Card Application Management System
Developed a web-based Credit Card Application Management System using Python (Django) and SQLite. The system allows users to apply for credit cards online and track their application status. The admin dashboard enables management of applications, sub-admins, and reports, while also providing tools for content and profile management. The project includes a user-friendly interface for applicants and comprehensive admin features such as application status management, report generation, and account settings. Technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Django for the backend.
